    ``Base.metadata.create_all`` creates tables that are missing but never
    touches tables that already exist — so a user upgrading repowise across
    a release that *added a column* to an existing table will see runtime
    failures like ``no such column: decision_records.verification`` until
    the column is added by hand.

    This function closes that gap generically. It walks every table in
    ``Base.metadata`` and, for each table that already exists in the
    database, issues additive DDL for any **columns** or **indexes**
    declared on the model but missing in the live schema. The reconciler
    is driven entirely by the model definition, so any future migration
    that follows the additive-only convention is picked up automatically
    on the next ``init_db`` call — no per-migration code required here.

    Limitations (intentional — these need explicit migrations):
      * column **removals**, **renames**, or **type changes** are NOT
        reconciled (SQLite can't ALTER COLUMN safely anyway);
      * **constraint changes** (UNIQUE, CHECK, FK) on existing columns
        are NOT reconciled;
      * Postgres extensions / functions (e.g. pgvector) are NOT created
        here — those still belong in Alembic migrations.

    Uses a sync connection (via ``run_sync``) so the SQLAlchemy DDL compilers
    work directly.

    **Not atomic on SQLite, deliberately convergent instead.** ``init_db``
    opens a transactional block, but pysqlite does not begin a transaction for
    DDL, so every ``ALTER TABLE`` and ``CREATE INDEX`` here autocommits as it
    runs. A statement that fails therefore cannot be rolled back, and aborting
    the loop would strand every table ordered after the victim in
    ``Base.metadata`` on that call and on every later one: a permanently
    half-migrated store. So a failed statement is recorded and the walk
    continues, and the first failure is re-raised once the walk is done. Two
    properties follow, both wanted:

      * calling again makes progress, because the tables after the victim are
        reached on the first call rather than never;
      * the caller still sees the error, so a write path fails as loudly as it
        did before. The read paths pair this with
        ``reconcile_schema_best_effort``, which swallows it on purpose.

    On a backend with transactional DDL (PostgreSQL) the first failure poisons
    the transaction, so continuing is pointless and the error is raised at
    once, which keeps that backend's existing all-or-nothing behaviour.
